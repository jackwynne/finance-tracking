# Prove It Works

Verify every task output by checking the real thing directly. Do not infer from proxies, self-reports, or "it compiles."

**Why:** Unverified work has unknown correctness. Indirect verification (file mtimes, output freshness, agent self-reports, cached screenshots) feels cheaper than direct observation. Acting on a wrong inference costs far more than checking the source.

**Pattern:** After completing any task, ask: "how do I prove this actually works?"

Check the real thing, not a proxy:
- Check process liveness directly, not indirectly through derived state
- Read the actual value, not a cached or derived representation
- When verification fails, suspect the observation method before suspecting the system

Choose evidence for the change. For instructions or documentation, inspect the actual diff and validate changed metadata and references. For code, run the repository checks and exercise the affected behavior. Use an integration or UI path when that is needed to prove the change. Do not require a full build or end-to-end run for every edit. Stop after the required checks pass unless new evidence calls for more testing.

Delegation: trust artifacts, not self-reports.
When verifying delegated work, inspect the actual output artifact (git diff, file contents, runtime behavior), not the delegate's summary. Agents report what they intended, not always what happened.

## Script the check when you can

Reuse an existing deterministic check when it proves the behavior. Add a script only when it provides useful evidence that existing checks cannot supply. Record the command and result; a new file is not required for a small change.

Keep the artifact visible for the human. Commit it only for large or complex work where the trail has to be auditable later, like a big port or migration (the **show-me-your-work** skill). Most work just needs it visible, not committed.
